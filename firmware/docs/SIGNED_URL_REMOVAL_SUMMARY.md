# Signed URL Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed signed URL implementation for public agents and simplified the WebSocket connection process. The system now connects directly to public ElevenLabs agents without requiring signed URLs or API keys.

## Changes Made

### 1. **WebSocket Client Header (`websocket_client.h`)**
- Removed `use_signed_url` parameter from `begin()` method
- Removed `signedUrl` member variable
- Removed `useSignedUrl` flag
- Removed `getSignedUrl()` method declaration

### 2. **WebSocket Client Implementation (`websocket_client.cpp`)**
- Simplified `begin()` method to only accept agent ID
- Removed all signed URL logic from constructor
- Updated `begin()` to connect directly to public agent endpoint
- Simplified `reconnect()` method to use direct connection
- Completely removed `getSignedUrl()` function implementation

### 3. **Main Application (`main.cpp`)**
- Updated `initializeElevenLabs()` to use simplified connection
- Removed `isPublicAgent` parameter from `elevenLabsClient.begin()`

### 4. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated `elevenlabs_websocket.md` for public agent support
- Updated `websocket_flow.md` to reflect direct connection
- Updated `ELEVENLABS_SDK_IMPLEMENTATION.md` to document simplified approach

## Connection Process (New)

For public agents, the connection is now straightforward:

```cpp
// Old way (with signed URL)
bool isPublicAgent = true;
elevenLabsClient.begin(ELEVEN_LABS_AGENT_ID, isPublicAgent);

// New way (simplified)
elevenLabsClient.begin(ELEVEN_LABS_AGENT_ID);
```

### WebSocket Connection Details
- **Endpoint**: `wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=YOUR_AGENT_ID`
- **Authentication**: None required for public agents
- **SSL/TLS**: Enabled with certificate validation
- **Heartbeat**: 30-second intervals for connection health

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex signed URL logic
2. **Better Performance**: No HTTP request overhead for signed URLs
3. **Reduced Memory Usage**: No storage of signed URL strings
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer code paths to maintain
5. **Direct Connection**: Faster initial connection setup

## Verification

The following components have been updated and tested:
- ✅ Header file definitions
- ✅ Implementation logic
- ✅ Main application integration
- ✅ Documentation consistency
- ✅ No compilation errors

## WebSocket Flow

1. **Connection**: Direct WebSocket to agent endpoint
2. **Handshake**: Standard ElevenLabs conversation initiation
3. **Communication**: Full message flow support (audio, text, tools)
4. **Reconnection**: Automatic with exponential backoff

This change makes the codebase cleaner and more suitable for public agent deployments where signed URLs are not required.
